A toy IRC client, written to explore creating TUI interfaces, and using the irc library.

# Usage
`cargo run` will run the IRC client, with `config.json` loaded from the
current directory. An example `config.json` file is provided, which connects
to irc.mozilla.org. For the configuration format, see [here](https://github.com/aatxe/irc).
